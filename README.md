# AutomaticRotation - a little Python script

## Introduction
A short python script which tries to rotate images to their right orientation.
It uses OCR through pytesseract to detect the actual orientation.

## Execution
- Your images must be in a folder called "INPUT". This is to process only the desired Images.
- Change the PATH of tesseract to your PATH.
- Execute the script in the folder which contains the folder "INPUT".
- The resulting images get saved in a newly created folder named "OUTPUT".
